# Left-Ventricle-Full-Quantification-Challenge-MICCAI-2019

Challenge acronym: LVQuan19

Challenge description:

This challenge is an extension of Left Ventricle Full Quantification Challenge MICCAI 2018 (LVQuan18), the main difference is that this challenge (LVQuan19) will provide original data without preprocessing for training and testing phases,which is more clinical than the data providing by LVQuan18. The challenge addresses the analysis of left ventricles (LV) in patients undergoing cardiac MRI.To assess the heart's function, the LV's function, morphology and temporal dynamics is of clinical interest. This analysis in clinical routine is time consuming and prone to error and inter-observer variability. In this challenge the extraction of the LV's cavity and myocardium and subsequently the regression of regional wall thicknesses, LV dimensions and the classification of the phase of the cardiac cycle are to be performed. These are common and significant parameters to assess the LV function. The aim of this challenge is to learn effective machine learning models that can estimate a set of clinical significant LV indices (regional wall thicknesses, cavity dimensions, area of cavity and myocardium, cardiac phase) directly from MR images. No intermediate segmentation is required in the whole procedure.


Key expected outcome of the challenge:
  
  Learn effective machine learning models that can estimate a set of clinical significant LV indices (regional wall thicknesses, cavity dimensions, area of cavity and myocardium, cardiac phase) directly from MR images.
